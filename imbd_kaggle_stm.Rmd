## Data preparation

We might want to delete this data chunk because we didn't do stuff with it in the end.

```{r data trial 1}
# Kaggle Data 1 - Has Revenue but not Country
dat <- read.csv("data/imdb_1972-2019.csv")

# Exploring the dataset
names(dat)

# Look at duplicates 
dat %>% filter(duplicated(.[["Title"]]))

# Selecting the variables we are going to use and remove duplicates
# remove year and genre - we won't use them in our model
dat1 <- dat %>% 
  select(Title, Rating, Metascore, Description, Runtime..Minutes.,
         Revenue..Millions.) %>% 
  distinct(Title, .keep_all = TRUE)
names(dat1)

# Check for duplicates 
dat1 %>% filter(duplicated(.[["Title"]])) 

# convert factors to character columns  
dat2 <- dat1 %>%
  mutate_if(is.factor, as.character)

# Check classes of columns
sapply(dat2, class) 

```
